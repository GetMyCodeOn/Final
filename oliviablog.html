<h4><a name="DayOne" style = "color:Black">Day One: Blind Leading the Blind</a>
				</h4>
					<p>First day at Founders and Coders! We were thrown right in at the deep end and asked to create a blog site by the end of the week! Initially, we were split into teams of four with each member taking on a role for the week, mine being the tutor. Team #GetMyCodeOn was born! Firstly, we had to set up our development (dev) environments and create a repository on github, which would become our blogsite. I spent the rest of the day along with my team members attempting to get to grips with all the commands git pull/git commit etc. After a frustrating day of error line after error line we finally managed to set up an organisation team page on git hub and created our first repository!</p>
					
				<h4><a name = "DayTwo"style = "color:Black">Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!</a></h4>	
					<p>I started off the day making myself familiar with the terminal on my laptop and all the different features it could do. Just before lunch, as my role as tutor, I gave a quick demo of my development environment and some of the exciting features I had discovered on my command line. 
					In the afternoon we began to create the bare bones of our website using HTML and CSS. Once this had been made we became to play around with Twitter Bootstrap, and Jekyll, two front-end frameworks for styling sites.
</p>	
				<h4><a name = "DayThree"style = "color:Black">Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde</a></h4>
					<p>I began the day by watching a series of tutorials on twitter bootstrap and working through them to create a more functional and visually appealing site page. Just before lunch I gave a tutorial on how to make a button on your webpage that links to a website (see tutorial here), something I had just learnt that morning! By that afternoon, as a team, we had created five functional pages using twitter bootstrap that looked great! We then began to experiment with Jekyll which proved frustrating, the styling didn’t seem to be very compatible with the bootstrap styling we had used and the result wasn’t great. </p>
					
				<h4><a name = "DayFour"style = "color:Black">Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll</a></h4>
					<p>After struggling with Jekyll some more, I decided to ditch it in favour of twitter bootstrap and just focus on making the pages functional and look nice. I began to play around with some of the features of twitter bootstrap and gave a tutorial on the grid system and the how websites built with twitter bootstrap are scalable so can be viewed on any sized device easily (check it out on your phone!).  Towards the end of the day we began the arduous process of linking our five pages together to create our blog in time for the deadline tomorrow. Try as we might, we were unable to link them together without seeing a 404 error and left in the evening feeling rather dejected. 

</p>

				<h4><a name = "DayFive"style = "color:Black">Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road</a></h4>
				<p>Poised with a fresh, optimistic attitude we attempted to tackle our linking problem and successfully managed to link our five pages before 10 am! Huzzah! Now that we had a webpage which linked successfully (ish) to the other pages, we were able to focus on the content of the page and add in some new features. I gave a tutorial on using links within a webpage to navigate to different sections and began to build a navigation bar in the blog page. At the end of the first week we had successfully created a functional webpage! Go team #GetmyCodeOn! </p>
