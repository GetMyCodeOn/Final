<h4><a name="DayOne" style = "color:Black">Day One: Blind Leading the Blind</a>
				</h4>
					
					<p>Sat here wondering how on earth I will get through the next 7-weeks and come out the other end being able to fully get my code on. 16 of us sat in a room that seemed to be embodying the term "blind leading the blind."
Like</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayTwo"style = "color:Black">Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!</a></h4>	
					
					<p>Our gits were pushing and pulling and ready to commit our code just simply needed to put together some code, bootstraps and jekyll 
By 4pm we had a working blog yay! The group morale is a lot better and I think we are on track for all the boot strapping and jekylling tomorrow.. stay tuned to find out.</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayThree"style = "color:Black">Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde</a></h4>
					
					<p>I think this is the best thing I could have done before starting a new chapter in life - starting my own business. Not even because of the technical aspects of the course. It's the way this course is developing and shaping mindsets and attitudes.
1. Don't give up - the amount if times things don't work but you have to keep trying and keep figuring out ways to do it 
2. No one will tell you what to do - same with your business - figure it out 
3. Patience patience patience 
4. Don't reinvent the wheel - people have been coding for years- if you can copy their code do it - Greg from sparroh. People have been setting up businesses for years and there is a lot of best practice out there- learn from the best because somewhere somehow someone has done what you want to do in some shape or form!
Really, not matter what you want to do next in life, this course is for you!</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayFour"style = "color:Black">Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll</a></h4>
					
<p>Your environment dictates your work ethic. 
If feel like the stupidest in the class, good. It means you can only become better. If you're the cleverest in the class, you are your own benchmark. The environment at founders and coders is that no one wants to give up when faced with a challenge And it's helping me develop the same mindset.
This is the best place to be as a graduate, wantrepreneur, entrepreneur or anything else</p>

			<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge</a></h4>
					<p>
Client side developer challenge this week! This week I am the presenter aka. the project managers right hand woman. Its my role to ensure that we have some sort of working code by 4pm everyday to present back to the rest of the class. Today was a day of googling all the terms that we were unfamiliar with in our brief, AJAX, asynchronous data fetching, JSON..?  We began to develop an idea of what we would be doing but how we would be doing it would take another days workâ€¦ 

					</p>
				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS</a></h4>	<p>
The team tried to work through how to write the code to meet the brief. A good thing about this course is that everyone is up for helping everyone. We roped in other teams to help us understand more about how to approach the task and by the end of the day had working code to present. 

				</p>
				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day Eight: DNRY</a></h4>

				<p>
Crunch time was getting closer - Stephan Fowler will be coming in tomorrow to review each teams work. I could feel the added layer of stress in the room as we were working to an external deadline. 
				</p>

				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day Nine: Show Time! </a></h4>
				
				<p>
Stephan would be coming at 5! We spent the day refining our code and making sure that we were adhering to the style guide. I worked on trying to get to grips with all the code so I would be able to present it back. We were the first team up and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In Stephans words "I have very little to critique." The feedback across all teams was very positive and we all felt proud presenting our final work.
				</p>

				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day Ten: Minor Tweaks</a></h4>
				<p>Wrap up - This week was a lot harder than the last, It was a lot more technical and less design work. I struggled a lot however, it was good to see everyone coming together to solve the problem. 

We created a widget which sourced data from the Guardians website for News, Travel and Sport using an application programming interface. We made a desktop version which was also mobile compatible and began to think about progressive enhancement and graceful degradation when creating applications.

			<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day 11 - Changing approach</a></h4>
					<p>
After not being able to attempt the weekend homework on node school I came in on Monday somewhat confuse and disheartened. However, the whole class felt the same so it made things a bit better. We spent the day trying to go through the exercises in node school as a class however it was still yet to make sense to me. The hardest part was trying to discipline yourself mentally to keep trying even though you can't understand what is going on and everyone seems to be ovine forward.
					</p>
				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day 12 - Tough going</a></h4>	<p>
Today there seemed to be a natural progression for some however for me and other members it still made no sense. Again it was hard to maintain focus as I still had not got to grips with what we were doing yesterday. But Dan assured us that we will all make it to the end! 

He also did say that this week would be the hardest week which bought some relief, kind of.
				</p>
				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day 13 - Learnyounode</a></h4>

				<p>
Still feeling lost and some what demotivated me and Jack teamed together to start again from the start. We were very behind (a whole two days behind), but it didn't make sense to carry on blindly. I felt like that 'special' child in the class who needed extra assistance. 

Dan still assured us we will make it!  
				</p>

				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day 14 - The damned sixes</a></h4>
				
				<p>
Me and Jack were still behind but decided to join the rest of the class again. We were on a tight schedule with hourly slots to work on each problem and then Dan would pick a name out the hat to present the problem. Things started to make sense and it was very endearing to see how we were all working together to explain the content, filling in the gaps of each other and making sure everyone was on the same page.

				</p>

				<h4><a style = "color:Black">Day 15 - Nodeschool out</a></h4>
				<p>
It finally makes sense, kind of! After a painful week of node school things started to click. We worked through the rest of the node school exercises. I found myself being able to explain some of the stuff that we had been going through, I didn't even know I knew it! I guess something had been going in this last week. 

This week was a week of frustration to say the least. Words from Dan - Part of being a developer is being able to work through the feeling of "I'm dumb I don't get it." That was definitely the feeling of this week. More then ever this course is developing mental resilience when faced with challenges!
